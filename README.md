# Email-Generator
Email Class
This Java program defines an Email class to create company email accounts for employees. It generates unique email addresses, assigns passwords, and allows customization of mailbox capacity and alternate email addresses.

How to Use
Create an instance of the Email class by providing the employee's first name and last name.

The program will prompt you to choose a department code (1 for Sales, 2 for Development, 3 for Accounting, or 0 for unknown).

You can choose to create your own password or let the program generate one for you.

Enter a company suffix for the email address (e.g., "company.com").

The program will create an email address based on the provided information.

You can set the mailbox capacity, alternate email, change the password, and adjust the password length using the available methods.

Use the InfoCheck method to retrieve information about the email account.

I Enhanced a Java Email Generator based on insights gained from a reference video, implementing significant improvements to the application:
